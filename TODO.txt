DELIVERABLE 1 (SPA WORKING IN KUBERNETES)
-----------------------------------------
1. Test on Windows via choco

DELIVERABLE 2 (SIMPLER FINAL SPA AND TOKEN HANDLER)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Get rid of submodules from FinalSPA

2. Token handler to use local setup and avoid testing of business API

3. SPA to use full tests against deployed Docker components

4. oauth.localtokenhandler.deployment repo

5. Redeploy SPA, tokenhandler and functionbeat config to AWS
   Test cloud logging is fully working for both business API and token handler API
   
6. Reconsider certificate management in Docker and use of shared repo
   Currently it forces some strange domain names
   Kubernetes will also require extra domain names

DELIVERABLE 3 (LOGGING)
-----------------------
1. Elastic base components

2. Update Final APIs to use userID / method
   Also the Express code in token handler

3. Filebeat and schema updates for userID / method and in line with work
   Use same techniques as work for pipeline
   Update the logaggregation repo

4. Update READMEs and make public

5. Delete existing data
   Update to latest Elastic version

6. Update Serverless API and token handler serverless code to use userID / method

7. Recreate the schema and pipelines, then redeploy
   Ensure that live functionbeat config is backed up to Google drive
