DAEMONSET
---------
Cannot resolve host names from multitool daemonset pods
/etc/resolv.conf seems different

Avoid deploying multitool daemonset to control plane node

MULTINODE INGRESS
-----------------
This shows that ingress is installed on oauth-m02 only:
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx -o wide

So I need to get the right IP and use that in the hosts file:
minikube node list -p oauth

UNDERSTAND NETWORK
------------------
Go through the book and use hyperkit VMs plus PODs
